Phishing Website Detector
An AI-powered cybersecurity tool to detect phishing websites using *Machine Learning and Flask*.

🔹 Overview
Phishing scams are a major cybersecurity threat, tricking users into revealing sensitive information via fraudulent websites. Traditional blacklist-based detection is ineffective against dynamically created phishing domains.  
This project applies *AI-driven phishing classification*, leveraging *Random Forest machine learning models* for real-time detection.


📌 Features
✅ AI-Powered Phishing Detection (ML model predicts phishing risks)  
✅ Feature-Based Analysis (Extracts key attributes from URLs)  
✅ Web-Based Interface (Simple Flask-powered UI for users)  
✅ Real-Time Classification (Identifies legitimate vs. phishing websites)  

🚀 Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Prerequisites
python installation. Then, install dependencies:  

pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib

2️⃣ Run the Application
python app.py

Open *http://127.0.0.1:5000/* in your browser.
3️⃣ Test with URLs
Enter a website link in the input field to classify *Phishing vs. Legitimate*.
