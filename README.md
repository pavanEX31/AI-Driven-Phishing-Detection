Phishing Website Detector An AI-powered cybersecurity tool to detect phishing websites 

using Machine Learning and Flask.

🔹 Overview Phishing scams are a major cybersecurity threat, tricking users into revealing 

sensitive information via fraudulent websites. Traditional blacklist-based detection is 

ineffective against dynamically created phishing domains.

This project applies AI-driven phishing classification, leveraging Random Forest machine 

learning models for real-time detection.

📌 Features ✅AI-Powered Phishing Detection (ML model predicts phishing risks)

✅ Feature-Based Analysis (Extracts key attributes from URLs)

✅ Web-Based Interface (Simple Flask-powered UI for users)

✅ Real-Time Classification (Identifies legitimate vs. phishing websites)

🚀 Setup Instructions 1️⃣Prerequisites python installation. Then, install dependencies:

pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib

2️⃣Run the Application 

python app.py

Open http://1️2️7.0.0.1️:5000/ in your browser. 

Test with URLs Enter a website link in the input field to classify Phishing vs. Legitimate.
